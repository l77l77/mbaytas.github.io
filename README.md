His academic research is situated at intersections of design and computer science. To date, he has co-authored more than 30 research publications (including ACM DIS Best Paper and ACM CHI Honorable Mention award-winners), as well as research grants which collectively received more than $4M from state, non-profit, and corporate benefactors in Turkey and Sweden. 

His academic work began on the inaugural research team of the Koç University Design Lab, where he received the first graduate degree granted by the university’s innovative Design, Technology & Society program. He then served as the founding coordinator of Koç University – Arçelik Research Center for Creative Industries (KUAR), completed a Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD fellowship hosted by Qualisys AB, held a postdoctoral research and teaching position at Chalmers University of Technology’s t2i Lab, taught at the University of Gothenburg, and supervised research at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Dr. Baytaş has degrees in mechanical engineering and economics from Koç University, a high school diploma from Robert College of Istanbul, certification as a yoga teacher, and a collection of credentials in topics related to design, engineering, and business. He grew up in İstanbul, Turkey, and currently resides in Sweden.
