His academic research is situated at intersections of design and computer science. To date, he has co-authored more than 30 research publications (including ACM DIS Best Paper and ACM CHI Honorable Mention award-winners), as well as research grants which collectively received more than $4M from state, non-profit, and corporate benefactors in Turkey and Sweden. 

Dr. Baytaş has degrees in mechanical engineering, economics, and design from Koç University, a high school diploma from Robert College of Istanbul, certification as a yoga teacher, and a collection of credentials in topics related to design, engineering, and business.

His academic work began on the inaugural research team of the Koç University Design Lab, where he received the first graduate degree granted by the university’s innovative Design, Technology & Society program. He then served as the founding coordinator of Koç University – Arçelik Research Center for Creative Industries (KUAR), completed a Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD fellowship hosted by Qualisys AB, held a postdoctoral research and teaching position at Chalmers University of Technology’s t2i Lab, taught at the University of Gothenburg, and supervised research at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

I am currently curious about the following:

**How to be a scholar-entrepreneur, or a "self-employed professor"?**  
**How to foster a community where entrepreneurs, academics, and craftspeople think in synergy?**

I produce [Design Discipline](http://designdisciplin.com), a long-term research project and online publication that was born to prove that both of these things are possible.

**How to build entertaining and refreshing experiences with small, quiet, and safe autonomous drones for home environments?**  
**How to lower the bar for creatives to build with drones and robots?**  

To work on these and related questions, I authored the "Social Drones" research project which funds a research group at Chalmers University of Technology with an approx. $1.5M grant from The Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program – Humanities and Society (WASP-HS) between 2020-2024.

**How to obviate the trade-off between user experience and security in digital access and authentication?**  
**How to embody preciousness, sentimental value, and personal imprints in artifacts with digital components?**

To investigate these questions in tandem, I authored the "Precious Keys" research project which funds a PhD researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology with an approx. $0.5M grant from the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet) between 2020-2023.

**How to synthesize artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, and handcraft in objects of desire?**  

In an ongoing design and art projects I am prototyping artifacts that digital and handcrafted components in tandem. (Currently in stealth mode.)
