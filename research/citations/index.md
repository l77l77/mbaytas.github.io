Citations is a collection of piece-unique NFTs representing works of scientific scholarship whose impact has re-shaped the material and cultural world we inhabit.

Reciprocating to the classical recording system of scholarly publishing, Citations expresses these canonical works on a contemporary recording system, the blockchain.

Citations honors computer science at large, and it is intimately connected to my own research. The project was inspired and informed by our research on [Digital Preciousness](https://www.baytas.net/research/digitalpreciousness/) and [Computational Heirlooms](https://www.baytas.net/research/computationalheirlooms/), and in turn, feeds back insights we could not get without personally participating in the ecosystem. Proceeds from the sales of Citations NFTs support my research -- including but not limited to costs of software, prototypes, acquiring professional design and engineering services, as well as participatng in the relevant research communities by attending conferences, etc.
