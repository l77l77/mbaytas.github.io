Citations is a collection of piece-unique NFTs representing works in computer science whose impact has re-shaped the material and cultural world we inhabit.

Reciprocating to the classical recording system of scholarly publishing, Citations expresses these canonical works on a contemporary recording system: the blockchain.

Citations honors computer science research at large, while being intimately connected to my own research. The project was inspired and informed by our research on [Digital Preciousness](https://www.baytas.net/research/digitalpreciousness/) and [Computational Heirlooms](https://www.baytas.net/research/computationalheirlooms/), and in turn, feeds back insights we could not get without personally participating in the ecosystem. Proceeds from the sales of Citations NFTs support my research -- including but not limited to costs of software, prototypes, acquiring professional design and engineering services, as well as participatng in the relevant research communities by attending conferences, etc. As such, Citations is an experiment in business model innovation around how scholarly research is funded and disseminated.

Each Citations collectible bears a reference to an important publication in computer science, in full academic citation format; as well as a bespoke illustration based on the visual communication devices (figures, graphs, equations, tables) that appear in the original work. The text and figures are typeset with utmost attention to detail, and properties embedded in the NFT record provide information on the typefaces utilized in the design.
