Hotspotizer is a visual programming tool for mid-air gesture-based user interfaces.

Used with a Kinect sensor, it allows people to design and implement custom full-body gestures without coding. The gestures are mapped to system-wide keyboard commands which can be used to control any application.

Hotspotizer allows everyone -- designers, hobbyists, students... -- to integrate 3D gesture sensing into their projects. Applications include digital arts and design education, ultra-rapid prototyping, gaming, and adapting arbitrary keyboard-controlled software for gesture control.

While open source Hotspotizer app is tailored to work specifically on Windows, with the Microsoft Kinect sensor; the UI design concept "space discretization" can be adapted for many different 3D motion and position sensors like Leap Motion and general-purpose motion capture, as well as to robot path programming.
