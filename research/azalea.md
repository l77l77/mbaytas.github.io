In response to social distancing due to the pandemic, we sought new ways to create a sense of "togetherness” while physically distant. The result was Azalea: a smartphone-based design that consist of a bespoke app and a tactile cushion which envelops the phone.

A pair of Azaleas can be used by two people to enrich a phone call. The artifact is brought to life by inserting the phone, running the Azalea app, into the cushion. Doing so, the user "sacrifices" the phone, invoking a "magical" communication experience where the mediating hardware is out of sight.

The design uses the phone's flash to project light, through cut-out shapes on the back of the cushion, into the user’s environment. The phone's screen glows in color through the pattern on the front, reacting to the intensity of the speech. A shared soundscape of crackling fire, ocean waves, and singing bowls frames the conversation, driven by subtle motions of the artifacts held in the users' hands.

Most designs for enriching remote conversations increase the quantity and fidelity of what is communicated. Azalea follows a different design ethos we called "diminished reality" – it removes and obfuscates signals as well as distractions, creating space so we can focus on what really matters.

Through Azalea, we aim to inspire fellow designers to creatively leverage the – often untapped – capabilities that can be found in our smartphones, and to build on "diminished reality" as a design ethos.
