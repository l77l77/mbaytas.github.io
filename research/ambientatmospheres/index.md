# **Ambient Atmospheres**

*Experiments in Light, Space, Algorithms, and Memories*

Ambient Atmospheres began as an open-ended, exploratory research-through-design project and culminated in an exhibition titled Bright Memories.

Building on a philosophical notion of "playful hacking" from scholarly literature on human-computer interaction design, the team created numerous prototypes over six months; experimenting with materials, algorithms, electronics, mechanics, graphic design, lighting design, architectural scale prototyping, software development, and social perceptions.

The design experiments culminated in a room-scale installation Bright Memories at Gothenburg's A Working Lab, exhibited during the summer of 2021. The focal point of the installation: an interactive centerpiece composed of 7 floating light windows, constructed by "upcycling" parts from discarded LCD monitors. A console and cartridges fabricated from wood provide a tactile means to play back "memories" in the abstract light medium. Flanking the centerpiece, 10 posters open mysterious windows into the design and research process.

As a research project, Ambient Atmospheres demonstrates an archetype for "exploratory research through design" and proposes "threads of design" as a form of analysis and knowledge creation via constructive design research – in addition to revealing a wealth of tactical pointers for fabrication, integrated interaction design and engineering, and lighting design.
