# About

I am a ~~programmer + engineer + economist + academic + musician + writer + strategist + photographer + YouTuber + philosopher + teacher~~ designer + computer scientist born in Turkey, currently based in ~~Istanbul~~ Gothenburg.

I'm currently teaching at the joint Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg, and working on two strands of research:

- "[Social Drones](https://www.baytas.net/research/socialdrones/)" :: informing and creating designs for interactive autonomous drones, mainly for leisure and wellness applications. *This work is sponsored by Qualisys AB, and funded by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program – Humanities and Society.*
- "[Digital Preciousness](https://www.baytas.net/research/digitalpreciousness/)" :: experimenting with product and user interface designs that embody longevity and value. *This work is funded by Vetenskapsrådet (The Swedish Research Council) via a Natural and Engineering Sciences Grant hosted at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.*

I also produce and host [Design Disciplin](https://www.designdisciplin.com/) -- a [video](https://www.youtube.com/designdisciplin) [podcast](https://podcast.designdisciplin.com/) and [website]((https://www.designdisciplin.com/)) that seeks to illuminate diverse patches on the vast landscape of "design".
